## Technical Implementation

### Functions Added
- `handleCreateRoomWithId()` - Creates standard room with custom ID

### Navigation Flow
1. Super admin enters custom room ID
2. Selects creation type (standard or custom)
3. If custom, configures advanced settings
4. Room is created in Firebase Realtime Database
5. Auto-navigation to `/admin/room/{roomId}` for management

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Autonomous Random Game System
- Fully operational autonomous room finding/creation
- Background matching services active
- Enhanced with countdown timers and auto-start logic

### Admin Services
- Leverages existing `createGameAsAdmin()` function
- Uses `createCustomGame()` for advanced configurations
- Maintains compatibility with regular admin workflows

### Firebase Integration
- Rooms stored in Realtime Database under `/rooms/{roomId}`
- Game history automatically saved to Firestore
- Auto-cleanup of completed games after 10 seconds

## Benefits

1. **Streamlined Workflow**: Super admins can quickly create rooms without generating random IDs
2. **Player Accessibility**: Custom room IDs make it easier for players to join specific games
3. **Administrative Control**: Full oversight of all active rooms through integrated monitor
4. **Flexibility**: Choice between quick creation and detailed customization
5. **Consistency**: Similar interface to regular admin panel for familiar user experience
