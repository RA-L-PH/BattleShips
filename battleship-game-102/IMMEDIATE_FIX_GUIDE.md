# üöÄ IMMEDIATE FIX GUIDE - AI & Google Sheets Issues

## üî• CRITICAL: You're using placeholder API keys!

### Issue Identified:
Your `.env` file contains example/placeholder values that won't work:
- `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyC26WPoKlqHoImtB7C7FvCwwN-q_T_OiXs` ‚ùå (This is a placeholder)
- `VITE_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_WEB_APP_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/...` ‚ùå (This is an example URL)

## üõ†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED

### 1. Fix Gemini AI (For AI not making moves)

**Step 1: Get a real Gemini API key**
1. Go to: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated key (should start with `AIzaSy...`)

**Step 2: Update your .env file**
```bash
# Replace the placeholder with your REAL API key:
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyYOUR_REAL_API_KEY_HERE
```

### 2. Fix Google Sheets (For ability suggestions)

**Step 1: Set up Google Apps Script**
1. Go to: https://script.google.com/
2. Click "New Project"
3. Replace the default code with the content from `google-apps-script.js`
4. Save the project (Ctrl+S)
5. Click "Deploy" ‚Üí "New Deployment"
6. Set "Type" to "Web App"
7. Set "Execute as" to "Me"
8. Set "Who has access" to "Anyone"
9. Click "Deploy"
10. Copy the provided URL

**Step 2: Update your .env file**
```bash
# Replace with your REAL Google Apps Script URL:
VITE_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_WEB_APP_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_ACTUAL_DEPLOYMENT_ID/exec
```

## üß™ TESTING STEPS

### After updating .env:

1. **Restart your development server** (important for .env changes):
   ```powershell
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C if running)
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Run diagnostics in browser console**:
   ```javascript
   // Open browser console (F12) and run:
   battleshipDiagnostics.runDiagnostics()
   ```

3. **Test AI in a new game**:
   - Start a new game vs AI
   - Watch browser console for any errors
   - AI should make a move within 3-5 seconds

4. **Test ability suggestions**:
   - Try submitting an ability suggestion
   - Check browser console for success/error messages
