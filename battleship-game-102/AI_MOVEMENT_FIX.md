## AI Movement Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: AI Not Making Moves

The AI wasn't making moves because the system was checking for a valid Gemini API key and disabling itself when it found a placeholder value.

### What Was Fixed:

1. **Removed API Key Dependency**: The AI now works with local logic even without a real Gemini API key
2. **Enhanced Local AI**: Improved the fallback decision-making to be more intelligent
3. **Better Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error recovery and fallback mechanisms
4. **Debug Logging**: Added extensive logging to track AI decision process

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Modified `geminiAiService.js`:
- Removed the hard requirement for a valid Gemini API key
- Enhanced the `getFallbackDecision()` function with better AI logic
- Added comprehensive debug logging throughout the AI decision process
- Improved the `makeFallbackMove()` function to handle all scenarios

#### 2. Enhanced Local AI Logic:
The AI now uses this priority system:
1. **Hunt Mode**: If it has a hit, continue targeting adjacent cells
2. **Ability Usage**: Use HACKER for early intelligence, SCANNER for area detection
3. **Systematic Hunting**: Use checkerboard pattern for efficient ship finding
4. **Fallback**: Target any unknown cell

#### 3. Debug Information:
The AI now logs detailed information including:
- When it starts making a move
- What decision it makes and why
- If it's using local logic vs Gemini API
- Any errors and recovery attempts

### How to Test:

1. **Start an AI Game**: Create a new AI vs Player game
2. **Check Console**: Open browser developer tools and watch the console for AI logs
3. **Look for These Messages**:
   - `ðŸ¤– AI turn detected! Making move in 1 second...`
   - `âš¡ AI making move...`
   - `ðŸ¤– Using enhanced local AI logic`
   - `âœ… AI move completed`

### Expected AI Behavior:

The AI should now:
- âœ… Make moves even without a real Gemini API key
- âœ… Use intelligent targeting (hunt damaged ships)
- âœ… Use abilities strategically (HACKER early, SCANNER for intel)
- âœ… Fall back to systematic hunting when needed
- âœ… Provide detailed console logging for debugging

### If AI Still Doesn't Move:

1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify the game room has `gameStarted: true`
3. Check that `currentTurn` switches to the AI player ID
4. Look for any Firebase connectivity issues

### Getting a Real Gemini API Key (Optional):

If you want the full AI experience with Gemini:
1. Go to https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Create a new API key
3. Replace the placeholder in `.env`:
   ```
   VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_real_api_key_here
   ```

The AI will now work with both local logic (no API key needed) and enhanced Gemini logic (with real API key).
