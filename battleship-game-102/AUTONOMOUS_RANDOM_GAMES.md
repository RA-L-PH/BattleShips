# Autonomous Random Game System

## Overview
The Battleship game now features a fully autonomous random game mode that requires no admin intervention. Players can join a queue, get automatically matched, and play without any manual oversight.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Player Matching**
- **Queue System**: Players join a random game queue with their preferences
- **Smart Matching**: Players are matched based on compatible preferences (abilities, grid size)
- **Real-time Matching**: Background service matches players every 10 seconds
- **Bi-directional Detection**: Both players can detect when they've been matched

### 2. **Autonomous Room Creation**
- **Auto-populated Rooms**: When matched, both players are automatically added to the room
- **Pre-configured Settings**: Rooms are created with merged player preferences
- **No Manual Joining**: Players don't need to manually join rooms after being matched

### 3. **Auto-Start Mechanism**
- **Intelligent Game Detection**: System detects game mode and handles accordingly
- **Countdown for Excitement**: Random games start with a 3-2-1 countdown
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if auto-start fails
- **Status Updates**: Clear messaging throughout the process

### 4. **Background Services**
- **Auto-Matching**: Runs every 10 seconds to find compatible players
- **Queue Cleanup**: Removes expired queue entries every 5 minutes
- **Game History**: Automatically saves completed games to Firestore
- **Database Cleanup**: Clears completed games from Realtime DB
